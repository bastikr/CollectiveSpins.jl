Introduction
============

**CollectiveSpins.jl** is a numerical framework written in `Julia <http://julialang.org/>`_ that can be used to simulate quantum systems consisting of spatially distributed spins interacting via :ref:`section-interaction`, optionally coupled to a cavity.

The :ref:`section-geometry` module allows rapid creation of arbitrary placed spins to build up very general systems as explained in the :ref:`section-system` documentation. These in turn can then be investigated using either a complete quantum description or cumulant expansions up to second order. The details are presented in :ref:`section-descriptions`.
