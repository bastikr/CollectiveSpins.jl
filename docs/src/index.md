# Introduction

**CollectiveSpins.jl** is a numerical framework written in [Julia](http://julialang.org/) that can be used to simulate quantum systems consisting of spatially distributed spins interacting via [Dipole-Dipole interaction](@ref), optionally coupled to a cavity.

The [Geometry](@ref) module allows rapid creation of arbitrary placed spins to build up very general systems as explained in the [System](@ref) documentation. These in turn can then be investigated using either a complete quantum description or cumulant expansions up to second order. The details are presented in [Theoretical Descriptions](@ref).
